# Bad Mishka LLC Code of Conduct And Ethics

A code of conduct and ethics is a set of rules and practices applied
to a specific organization. This document is specifically for Open Source
Projects.

## Definitions

This code of conduct relies on the language of 
[Rfc2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)

Other Terms
 - **CREATOR** A person that created or started the project.
 - **ADMINISTRATOR** - A person that manages organizational resources and security privileges.  
 - **MAINTAINOR** - A person that can contribute code, accept/reject patches, and works with
 the community to push the project forward. 
 - **CONTRIBUTOR** - A person that MAY submit patches, new code, or other work to the project.
 - **USER** - A person that interacts with the final product.

## The Intent

The goal of this Code of Conduct is to set expectations of behavior, 
minimize drama and promote a culture of productivity, fun,
and appreciation.

**Drama** is defined as anything that purposefully wastes the time of 
others, placing undue priority and value on trivial matters, or
purposely exaggerating emotions and responses to garner sympathy
in situations as a ploy to emotionally manipulate others.  

The Code of Conduct MUST NOT supersede laws within an individual's respective
location. As such, all infractions of the law MUST be reported to the
appropriate governing body.  

## Limitations

This Code of Conduct and Ethics applies only to a project's respective
Open Source community.  The project's respective Open Source Community
are limited to mediums tied exclusively to a project such as:
 - **forums** solely devoted to a project. 
 - **mailing lists** solely devoted to a project. 
 - **wiki** solely devoted to a project. 
 - **commit messages** within a project. 
 - **project websites** A website devoted solely to the project
 - **social media accounts** The media account must be devoted solely to the project. 
 - **public events** The event must be devoted solely to the project. 

## Conduct  

This Code of Conduct only endorses the Golden Rule. 
All other ideologies are neither endorsed or repremanded by this document.  

    Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

### Respect yourself and others

Self-respect plays a significant role in software development. Self-respect requires 
pride and confidence in oneself and by extension pride in work that contributes to a project. 
 
Self-respect leads people to treat others with respect and honor rather than lowering one's 
actions and directing oneself in a heated moment.   
 
Respect includes the notion of showing consideration to others. Open source builds upon the
free time and labor of the community. Consider the consequences of 
 - the timing of a contribution
 - the impact of code 
 - how your words will impact others on a given project 
 - the time people take out of their day to interact with you. 
 
### Trust
Without trust, collaborative coding becomes ineffective as project maintainers
spend more time micromanaging a project that creating vision, leading, and
providing other meaningful contributions. 

Trust requires the belief that someone or something is reliable, good, honest, 
and effective. Good faith of users and contributors are assumed.  However,
Trust in an open source project, is earned through actions over time, not words
or status.

Thus its important that trust be earned and maintained through honest, reliable, 
and effective actions of individuals. 
  
### Collaboration
 
Working with others is required to build something greater than
ourselves. 

Praise and encourage positive behavior.

Collaboration requires patience, vision, trust, and 
communication. It's hard to achieve collaboration in a divisive 
environment; thus, communication SHOULD focus on technological
issues that can be solved.  
 
Divisive topics or statements such as religion, politics, and
things of a sexual nature MUST NOT be held on project communication 
mediums and spaces. Bringing up these topics on project related
medium MAY lead to permanent suspension from the project.  

Resolve conflicts with respect and civility. If a project Creator 
or Administrator gets involved, then all parties MAY be temporarily
suspended for a cool off period of no less than 30 days.

If any person at any time becomes a source of constant disruption to the project, 
a Creator or an Administrator MAY suspend, remove, or find creative means
to prevent further disruption.   
 
Report all illegal activies such as harassment and doxing cases to
the local authorities. An open source project is not designed or 
equipped to replace the criminal justice system.  
 
**Noteworthy Rules**
- Use usernames over real names, unless an individual gives permission to their name.
- Debates MUST be civil. 
- Attack problems, issues, and code, NOT people.
- Drama is disruptive to collaboration and thus not welcome.
- Lock threads that involve high emotion or vitriol.
- All false allegations are bannable offenses.  


### Celebration
Take time to celebrate major milestones, accomplishments, and contributions.
Never underestimate the power of a simple authentic "thank you". 
 
### Authenticity
This project values people that behave and communicate in an authentic manner. 
Communication MUST be direct, clear, concise, and congruent with an 
individual's intent.

### Do Not Spam
Do not pitch unsolicited 3rd party products, code, services, or 
documents. Spam MAY result in a ban or blacklist. 
 
### Step Down with Dignity
If you can no longer work on a project, please notify the project immediately
so that others may jump in to fill the gap. 
 
### Ask. Do not demand 
Constructive criticism directed toward code, bugs, and features are welcome. 

Coming off as needy, demanding, condescending will not be tolerated.  
Appeals to authority or popularity and using peer pressure will be tolerated.  
 
**Good Pitch** 
"Dropbox support would be awesome. Here is why:" (enumerate points based on facts)
