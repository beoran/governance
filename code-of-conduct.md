# Bad Mishka LLC Code of Conduct And Ethics

A code of conduct and ethics is a set of rules and practices applied to a specific organization.  

This code of conduct relies on the language of 
[Rfc2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)

The goal of this Code of Conduct is to set expectations of behavior, 
minimize drama and promote a culture of productivity, fun,
and appreciation.

**Drama** is defined as anything that purposefully wastes the time of 
others, placing undue priority and value on trivial matters, or
purposely exaggerating emotions and responses to garner sympathy
in situations as a ploy to emotionally manipulate others.  

The Code of Conduct MUST NOT supersede laws within an individual's respective
location. As such, all infractions of the law MUST be reported to the
appropriate governing body.  

## Limitations

This Code of Conduct and Ethics applies only to a project's respective
Open Source community.  The project's respective Open Source Community
are limited to mediums tied exclusively to a project such as:
 - **forums** solely devoted to a project. 
 - **mailing lists** solely devoted to a project. 
 - **wiki** solely devoted to a project. 
 - **commit messages** within a project. 
 - **project websites** A website devoted solely to the project
 - **social media accounts** The media account must be devoted solely to the project.

## Conduct  

This Code of Conduct only endorses the Golden Rule. 
All other ideologies are neither endorsed or repremanded by this document.  

    Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

### Respect yourself and others

Self-respect plays a significant role in software development. Self-respect requires 
pride and confidence in oneself and by extension pride in work that contributes to a project. 
 
Self-respect leads people to treat others with respect and honor rather than lowering one's 
actions and directing oneself in a heated moment.   
 
Respect includes the notion of showing consideration to others. Open source builds upon the
free time and labor of the community. Consider the consequences of 
 - the timing of a contribution
 - the impact of code 
 - how your words will impact others on a given project 
 - the time people take out of their day to interact with you. 
 
### Trust
Without trust, collaborative coding becomes ineffective as project maintainers
spend more time micromanaging a project that creating vision, leading, and
providing other meaningful contributions. 

Trust requires the belief that someone or something is reliable, good, honest, 
and effective. Good faith of users and contributors are assumed.  However,
Trust in an open source project, is earned through actions over time, not words
or status.

Thus its important that trust be earned and maintained through honest, reliable, 
and effective actions of individuals. 
  
### Collaboration
 
Working with others is required build something greater than
ourselves. 

Collaboration requires patience, vision, trust, and 
communication. It's hard to achieve collaboration in a divisive environment; thus,
communication SHOULD focus on technological issues that can be solved.  
 
Divisive topics or statements such as religion, politics, and
things of a sexual nature MUST NOT be held on project communication 
mediums and spaces. Bringing up these topics on project related
medium MAY lead to permanent suspension from the project.  

Report all Harassment and Doxing cases to the local authorities first. These are
bannable offenses and courts provide due process that an organization cannot. If
a Creator or Administrator is a witness to such blatant actions e.g. sees harassment on 
a mailing list, the Creator or Administrator MUST act on such evidence for the 
good of the community and remove all such persons from the community. 

Resolve conflicts with respect and civility. if a project Creator or Administrator
gets involved, then all parties MAY be temporarily suspended for a cool off period of no 
less than 30 days.

If any person at any time becomes a source of constant disruption to the project, 
Creator or Administrator MAY remove them for the good of the community.   
 
Praise and encourage positive behavior.
 
Noteworthy key items
